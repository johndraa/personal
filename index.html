            <h1> John Draa</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Software Developer</p>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer with experience building applications 
                across backend systems, user interfaces, and data-driven workflows. I work 
                primarily with Java and Python and have experience developing user-facing 
                applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with working with SQL 
                databases for data storage and retrieval. Through coursework and collaborative 
                development environments, I have developed strong foundations in object-oriented 
                programming, data structures, and the Software Development Life Cycle, with an 
                emphasis on writing maintainable code and working effectively in teams. I enjoy 
                solving practical technical problems and continue expanding my skills as I work 
                toward a professional career in software development.</p>

                <h3>Crypt of the Cubes</h3>
                <p> Crypt of the Cubes is a multiplayer roguelike survival game developed as part
                 of a team software engineering project. The game supports up to four players
                in real-time matches where players survive waves of enemies, collect upgrades,
                and progress through increasingly difficult levels. I served as the primary backend
                developer, designing and implementing the Java Spring Boot server responsible for player
                accounts, match management, character progression, and real-time communication between
                 clients. The system uses REST APIs and WebSockets to maintain server-authoritative gameplay, 
                 ensuring synchronized multiplayer sessions and persistent player progression across matches.</p>
                <img src= "./images/project2.png" alt="NFL Arrest Prediction Model">
                <h3>NFL Arrest Prediction Model</h3>
                <p> This project analyzes historical NFL game data to predict arrest risk levels at games 
                based on factors such as rivalry matchups, score differences, and game outcomes. Using Python 
                and machine learning libraries including scikit-learn and XGBoost, I performed data cleaning, exploratory 
                analysis, feature engineering, and model training to classify games into low, medium, or high arrest risk 
                categories. Multiple models were compared using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, with a tuned 
                XGBoost model achieving the best performance. The project demonstrates practical application of data science 
                workflows to extract insights and build predictive models from real-world event data.</p>
